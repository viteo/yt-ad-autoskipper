<h2><img align="center" height="40" src="logo.svg"> yt-ad-autoskipper</h2>

A browser extension that automates skipping and muting ad on YouTube. This is not an ad blocker, it just automates the process of clicking on the "Skip Ad" button on YouTube.

This is useful when you are watching a YouTube video (or a playlist), and an ad starts playing. YouTube allows you to skip the ad after 5 seconds, but if you can't be bothered to click it yourself (or you are AFK), this extension clicks that button for you.
